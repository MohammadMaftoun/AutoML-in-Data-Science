Welcome to the AutoML in Data Science repository! This repository is dedicated to exploring, implementing, and sharing automated machine learning (AutoML) tools and techniques within data science. Whether you're an experienced data scientist or just getting started, this repository presents resources and examples to help you leverage the strength of automation in your data science workflows.

# What is AutoML?

Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) is a set of techniques and tools that automate many redundant tasks in building machine learning models. This can include data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and more. AutoML aims to streamline the process of developing machine learning models, making it easier for data scientists to focus on higher-level tasks and insights.
In other words, AutoML is solving a machine-learning task in an automated way so that no (or minimal) manual effort is required. AutoML aims to allow non-experts to apply machine learning techniques to address a specific task without needing prior technical or domain knowledge. Most AutoML approaches aim to fully automatize the process of model selection, hyper-parameter optimization, and feature selection.
