Welcome to the AutoML in Data Science repository! This repository is dedicated to exploring, implementing, and sharing automated machine learning (AutoML) tools and techniques within the realm of data science. Whether you're an experienced data scientist or just getting started, this repository offers resources and examples to help you leverage the power of automation in your data science workflows.

# What is AutoML?

Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) is a set of techniques and tools that automate many repetitive tasks in building machine learning models. This can include data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and more. AutoML aims to streamline the process of developing machine learning models, making it easier for data scientists to focus on higher-level tasks and insights.
